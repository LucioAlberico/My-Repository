This is the code for Emergency Tracker, the website that we provided as a solution for the Red Cross Challenge at J.P. Morgan Code For Good 2022. This solution won the first place at the Hackathon.

Emergency Tracker aims to help the Red Cross achieve faster response times and promote volunteering.

The code was developed in 24 hours by a team of six people, including me, with the mentoring of JP Morgan software engineers.
