This is the code of Emergency Tracker, the website that we provided as a solution for the Red Cross Challenge at J.P. Morgan Code For Good 2022.

This solution won first place because it helps the Red Cross achieve faster response times and promotes volunteering.

The code was developed in 24 hours by a team of six people, including me, with the help of JP Morgan software engineers.
